## How do I select a single item?
When you click an item of content every piece of content that you own that intersects the point you touch will be selected. 
This can be a trap if you only want to select one item. 
To deselect unwanted items of content, click on that content in an area where only that content occurs. 
You may have to do this several times to isolate a single piece of content from many pieces of content 
that have been selected because they all overlap in the area that was selected. 
This is a subtractive method of content selection and is designed for mobile devices. 
It is the opposite of the additive method generally used in applications with a keyboard, such as PowerPoint.

## How do I undo an action?

An Undo button is not included because of the potential interactions between content belonging to different participants. 
If you want to undo a deletion, there is a feature that recovers deleted content. 

1. Click **Options**.
2. Click **Recycle Bin**.
3. Navigate to the deleted item and click **Restore Content**.

2. Click the text you want to edit.
