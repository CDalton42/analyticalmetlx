        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>MeTL supports learning in a collaborative space for teachers and students,
            providing deep analysis of user interaction and engagement.</p>

        <h3>Concepts</h3>

        <p>MeTL is at its heart a message hub with all messages being persisted for later retrieval.
            This makes it a system for virtualising rooms.</p>

        <p>Messages are sent to a specific space, and only people who are in that room will hear the message.</p>

        <p>Messages can be user level, and be visible to a human user, or system level and used to coordinate clients behaviour.</p>

        <p>All messages which have ever been through a room are retained, and can be replayed in order.
            Server side mechanisms optimize the results so that, for instance, a sentence which was published, moved and
            then later deleted does not show up in the client history at all.</p>

        <p>Conversations are structured as a collection of slides and some metadata.
            This is similar to the structure of a PowerPoint presentation, which enables some interoperability.</p>

        <p>A slide is a room.</p>

        <p>Each user has a private room on each slide.</p>

        <p>Each conversation has a conversation global room.
            Quizzes, submissions and attachments use this space, as they are not specific to a slide.</p>

        <p>A server global room carries configuration data to all connected clients
            (when a conversation is shared differently, for instance, this is broadcast globally in case that
            conversation needs to be added or removed from a search result).</p>
