After logging into MeTL, users are directed to the Conversation Search page.

To find a conversation, enter a query into the search box and click `Search` or press `Enter`. 
Search results are displayed in the table below. 

Initially the search box will be populated with the current username, 
resulting in a list of the conversations created by the current user.

## Search Results

### Lifecycle

This column shows the conversation status. Recently [created](#start-a-conversation) conversations show a `new` label, and [archived]({{site.baseurl}}/guide-edit-conversation.html#archive) conversations show an `archived` label. 
 
## Join a Conversation
 
Search for and click on the conversation you want to join and you will be taken to the 
[Whiteboard]({{site.baseurl}}/guide-whiteboard.html) for that conversation.

### Only my conversations

Check this box to only include conversations created by the current user in search results.

### Include my archived conversations

Check this box to include archived conversations created by the current user in search results.

## Edit a Conversation

Search for and click on the [Edit]({{site.baseurl}}/guide-edit-conversation.html) link on the conversation 
you want to edit.
 
## Start a Conversation

There are two ways to start a new conversation. 
Recently created conversations are tagged as **new** in the Lifecycle column.

### Create a Blank Conversation

This button creates an empty, unrestricted conversation with a single blank page. 
This is a good starting point for a free-form teaching session.   

### Create a Conversation by Importing a File

This button prompts for the user to choose a file to import, from which a new conversation will be created. 
This is useful when teaching materials have been created prior to the teaching session.
