## Group creation

A conversation can be split into groups.  This can only be done by the author of the conversation (the teacher).

The group will come into existence on a new page, which will appear in the conversation after the teacher's current page.  Each member of the class will be allocated into one and only one group.  The teacher will not be in any group but will be able to see all the content from all of them.

A member of a group can only see content from the other group members and the teacher.

The teacher starts creating a group by pressing the button on the top right of the screen.

This will open a configuration dialog.

The left side of this dialog is to capture enough information to enable the group page to be constructed correctly.  The right side of the dialog is to show the state of an existing group page.  The page will not be constructed and no user will be grouped until the teacher presses the "Fill" button in the center.

A group page will ensure that any student who enters it is placed into a group.

To do this, it needs to be told what to prioritize.  The author may choose a specific number of groups among which to evenly divide the students, or a maximum group size. 

The author may also choose to include groups from centralized systems such as D2L.  If these groups are included, those groupings are guaranteed, even if they conflict with the earlier priorities.  MeTL will only use the prioritization information to group students who do not appear in a group.  As these groups are toggled for inclusion, they appear on the right hand side of the dialog, in the groups space.

Only groups from the teacher's Org Units will be made available for inclusion.
