title: Teaching Examples
---

Stackable Regiments welcomes submissions of teaching examples to <a href="mailto:academy@stackableregiments.com">academy@stackableregiments.com</a>, which will be attributed to the provider and their institution (unless they wish to remain anonymous).  We reserve the right to not include the example.

Preference will be given to examples that have a brief explanation of the context and sufficient information for another teacher to reproduce it.  Supporting documented [pedagogical research](academy-pedagogy.html) (including citations where possible) is particularly valuable and encouraged, although this is not a requirement.
