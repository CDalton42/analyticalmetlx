title: Teaching Examples
---

Stackable Regiments welcomes submissions of teaching examples, which will be attributed to the provider and their institution (unless they wish to remain anonymous).

Submissions should be sent to <a href="academy@stackableregiments.com">academy@stackableregiments.com</a>.  We reserve the right to not include the example. Preference will be given to examples that have a brief explanation of the context and sufficient information for another [Conversation](guide-conversation.html) owner to reproduce it. 

Supporting documented [pedagogical research](academy-pedagogy.html) (including citations where possible) are particularly valuable and encouraged, although this is not a requirement.
