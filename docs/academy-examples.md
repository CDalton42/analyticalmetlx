Stackable Regiments welcomes submissions of teaching examples to <a href="mailto:academy@stackableregiments.com">academy@stackableregiments.com</a>, which will be attributed to the provider and their institution (unless they wish to remain anonymous).  We reserve the right to not include the example.

Preference will be given to examples that have a brief explanation of the context and sufficient information for another teacher to reproduce it.  Supporting documented [pedagogical research](academy-pedagogy.html) (including citations where possible) is particularly valuable and encouraged, although this is not a requirement.

## Prioritizing the Unit Objectives

The value of formally stating unit teaching and learning objectives is widely understood. Often unit objectives are presented to the students at the beginning of the semester. Some teachers require the students to sign a statement that they have read the objectives and may even read them out in the opening class. Often there is no formal discussion of the objectives and the copious printed copies of the objectives are wasted. If the objectives are worth giving to the students then it makes sense for some exercise to be built around them. 

The following example, which has been successfully used on individuals in a legal class, is much better suited to Informal Group work. In addition, since this is likely to be carried out in the first class, it has the advantage of breaking up existing friendships and getting students to know each other.

1. Prepare the conversation in advance of the class. At the point in the conversation when the objectives are to be discussed, create an informal group page. This can be done before any students have joined the conversation and they will be randomly assigned to groups as they join.
2. Type a list of the objectives in a text box but, instead of prioritizing them, type the list in a randomized order. Perhaps put an obviously less important objective first in the list as a provocation. The text box will be visible to every group.
3. Ask the students to find and sit with the other members of the group and prioritize the objectives. They can simply write a number next to the teacher provided list or type their own list.
4. A refinement would be to draw up the list of objectives in a table with the first column, including the objectives, and provide columns to the right, one for each group. The groups are then asked to type or handwrite their priority in their group column.
5. As they work out their list their group work is not visible to the other groups. The teacher can, by toggling the <code>Isolate</code> controls next to each group, watch the group discussion and either write a comment or question to provoke discussion in low-performing groups or move directly to the group in order to help.
6. When the allotted time is over the teacher can click on the <code>Show All</code> control to reveal all the groups' priorities. At this stage the teacher can invite public verbal discussion or move on.
7. A variant on this would be to have another Class Page, after the Group Page, with a pre-prepared copy of the Group table but now with enough columns for each student enrolled and each column assigned to an individual by name. This can be prepared as a template for future use and saved as an image. After the group discussion ask the students to now give their personal opinion by filling out their column in the table. This can be done publicly or privately and then revealed. This variant ensures that every student now has the ability to put their opinion, even if they failed to persuade their group of their view.

### Outcomes
 
Students are introduced to other students and start to learn to work with them, and students have to think and argue about the priorities of the unit. If the teacher took a snapshot and saved the final work on the pages then the class could revisit the objectives towards the end of the semester to reconsider the priorities and refresh their knowledge of the objectives.
