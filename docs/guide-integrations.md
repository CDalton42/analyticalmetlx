a.	Project this conversation allows only public content to be projected onto the class display. 
Good practice is to log in as the instructor on the class PC that controls the projector. 
Use the following procedure. Search for and join the conversation for the class on the class PC. 
Select Options and then Project this conversation. This will project only public content on the projector screen. 
Then log in and find the same conversation on the instructorâ€™s portable device. 
The projected display will follow everything the instructor does on the portable device. 
This allows the instructor to see their own private content and any information such as student names on submissions 
that should not be displayed to the students. To leave Project this conversation mode, on the class PC select Options, 
Conversations and select the current conversation and click on it. This will make the controls available.

b.	Deeplink this conversation will print the URL of the conversation into the URL bar. 
The URL can be copied and sent to students who can use it to directly join the conversation.

c.	Deeplink this slide will print the URL of the current page of a conversation into the URL bar. 
The URL can be copied and sent to students who can use it to directly join the page of the conversation.

d.	Export this conversation will export the conversation to OneNote provide the user has set up a OneNote account in 
Office 360 provided by Saint Leo University.

e.	Conversations will access the Search screen where conversations can be searched for, joined or created.

f.	Learning accesses a number of other options:
i.	Polls allows the instructor to create polls, view responses and display the poll on a page.
ii.	Attachments allows an instructor to upload a file of any kind so that students can download it in order to insert the content of the file as the owner so that the student can control where to put it and use private and public attributes.
iii.	Submissions allows the instructor to view student submissions where the name is attached. The instructor can also choose to display the submission on the next page, but the student name is removed from the public display.
iv.	Participants allows the instructor to see how active each student is on that page.
v.	Content filter allows the user to hide their own private or public content or that of other users. This action only hides content on the user screen, it does not delete it. This function on the class projector display can be used to temporarily hide student content to focus on instructor content and vice versa.
vi.	Manage banned content displays a record of any inappropriate content and the student name. The instructor can Unban All banned students or select individuals to unban.
