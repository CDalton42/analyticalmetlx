### Learning in Groups

*"The message is clear: What students learn is greatly influenced by how they learn, and many students learn best through active, collaborative, small-group work inside and outside the classroom"* (p 22)<a href="#footnote-a1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

While the value of promoting learning in groups is widely recognized, the issues of effectively and fairly managing group learning may not be commonly appreciated and extend beyond the universal concern of how to fairly and accurately assess group work and the individual contribution. Johnson and Johnson in various works explore key aspects and these are summarized in "What is Cooperative learning?" where the following point is made: *"Not all groups are cooperative (Johnson & Johnson, 2009<a href="#footnote-a2"><sup>2</sup></a>).  Placing people in the same room, seating them together, telling them they are a group, does not mean they will cooperate effectively.  To be cooperative, to reach the full potential of the group, five essential elements need to be carefully structured into the situation:  positive interdependence, individual and group accountability, promotive interaction, appropriate use of social skills, and group processing (Johnson & Johnson, 1989<a href="#footnote-a3"><sup>3</sup></a>, 2005<a href="#footnote-a4"><sup>4</sup></a>).”*<a href="#footnote-a5"><sup>5</sup></a> 

There are a number of issues associated with cooperative learning, that include (1) the benefits of cooperative learning, (2) how to structure group projects in order to maximise the benefits (as above), and (3) the contentious problem of how to assign students to groups. The first relates to the benefits of cooperative learning compared to intergroup competition, individual competition or individual student tasks.  Organizing students into cooperative learning groups has positive effects compared to not grouping students. There are beneficial effects on learning irrespective of whether the groups compete with one another or not, and this is true for students of all ability levels<a href="#footnote-a6"><sup>6</sup></a>.

The second issue is complex and Johnson and Johnson (*op. cit.*) are major contributors to the field. Their work highlights a significant deficiency in group teaching and learning where, too often, students are placed in groups and their cooperative, or non-cooperative work, is assessed by a summative group project. Rarely are the projects structured to develop in students the skills necessary to work cooperatively, even though this is a highly sought after attribute by employers. One problem has been the difficulty of monitoring group work in order to be able to provide effective contextual feedback. By working in MeTL, where the teacher can observe content directly by visiting the individual group work pages during the project, and by monitoring group analytics, the progress of group work becomes more transparent to the teacher.

The third issue relates to the way students are placed in groups, all of which have different consequences. Groups can self-select, or be assigned by the teacher. However, since friends tend to sit together in classes if the teacher groups by neighbouring students, this may have similar outcomes to students self-selecting. Alternatively teachers could use [Random-Selection](#random-selection) to assign students to groups, but this can be a little involved as a random number generator should be used which can be tedious especially for an ad-hoc group task. Another grouping method available to the teacher would be to group students together with similar abilities or other demographic attributes (homogeneous grouping). Conversely the teacher could group by dissimilar abilities or other attributes (heterogeneous grouping). Grouping students homogeneously or heterogeneously has advantages and disadvantages<a href="#footnote-a6"><sup>6</sup></a>.  (The 2nd Edition of this work<a href="#footnote-a7"><sup>7</sup></a> omits the research findings reported in the first edition). Homogeneous grouping on ability has a positive effect on achievement when compared to no grouping.  However, students of low ability perform worse when placed in homogeneous groups with other students of low ability as opposed to students of low ability placed in heterogeneous groups. There is a small positive effect of homogeneous grouping on high-ability students. Medium ability students benefit most from homogeneous grouping on ability compared to heterogeneous grouping<a href="#footnote-a6"><sup>6</sup></a>. 

Some authors contend there are ethical issues in placing high-ability students in heterogeneous groups as their achievement will be adversely affected. Conversely ability grouping has been criticized because of the implications for minority groups who may disproportionally originate from disadvantaged backgrounds<a href="#footnote-a8"><sup>8</sup></a>.

At this stage there is no clear consensus about the best way to group students in a class. Groups of friends tend to be less productive than groups of strangers as they may be more distracted. The consequences of [Self-Selection](#self-selection) or grouping by students sitting together should be considered. Using homogeneous or heterogeneous groups have different consequences. MeTL provides the teacher with various automatic methods of grouping that are designed to help the teacher manage the competing interests of ease of making groups, fairness, or purpose.

<a name="project-types"/> A final consideration is the scope and longevity of group projects which have been characterised as Informal, Formal and Base<a href="#footnote-a5"><sup>5</sup></a>. Informal cooperative learning projects last from a few minutes to one class and can, among other things, focus student attention, facilitate cognitive processing through rehearsal, and summarize. There is a distinct purpose in such a group activity. Teachers should use the MeTL grouping facility of <code>Only show me my participating students</code> since there is no point in grouping absent students and by attempting to do so some groups maybe suboptimal. Formal cooperative learning groups and cooperative base groups both have the requirement of group work that are longer term and therefore students who are absent when the group was established should be assigned so that they have an effective group when they rejoin the class. In this case teachers should use the facility of <code>Show me all my enrolled students</code>. 

At this stage, since there is no definitive research supported protocol for the best way to establish groups, MeTL gives the teacher some options but in the absence of the necessary information will randomly assign students to groups. This brief discussion of groups and cooperative learning does not provide any solutions to some very complex issues. However, hopefully, it does alert the teacher to some of the issues associated with groups and provides some methods that the teacher can utilise. The teacher can override the groups suggested by MeTL, or imported from the LMS, if MeTL is integrated with the LMS. However, students often have concerns about the grouping strategy the teacher employs and there are arguments for making grouping transparent and equitable. [Teacher-Selection](#teacher-selection), without being transparent, runs the risk of bias.

#### Self-Selection

Self-selected versus instructor-selected groups are often compared, but instructor selection can encompass a wide variety of methods from random, stratified random, homogeneous or heterogeneous groups.

The main advantages of self-selecting groups are the ease of administration (effectively let the students sort it out) and that students, at least the vocal ones, prefer it. The main disadvantages are that it is hard for students who do not know anyone else, it might further marginalize students who are already stigmatized in some way, and it is often seen as not being fair for all students<a href="#footnote-b1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

Self-Selection, where students form groups with minimal influence from the instructor, is often favoured by students because they know each other and will be able to work together productively. However, in the workforce employees are rarely able to choose their collaborators<a href="#footnote-b2"><sup>2</sup></a>.
 
One study, exploring student characterization of group formation effects, showed that self-selected students generally had a more positive group experience. Self-selected groups initially performed better than instructor-selected groups, but this effect disappeared over time. The self-selected groups perceived that they did better in their group although final grades indicated that group formation method did not affect group achievement (as measured by group project grades)<a href="#footnote-b3"><sup>3</sup></a>.  

However, project grades are not the only arbiter of choice and an important finding was that "individuals in instructor-formed involved learning to develop trust in others with whom they had no prior contact" and that development of trust might be viewed as "a superior outcome to the comparatively less challenging experience ... that ... existed within student-selected groups" (p 31)<a href="#footnote-b3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Although the authors found that student-selected groups had a more positive experience they "resisted the temptation to conclude that student-selection is the superior method for forming groups" (p 31)<a href="#footnote-b2"><sup>2</sup></a>, which is consistent with perceived benefits of heterogeneous groups.

The cited paper<a href="#footnote-b2"><sup>2</sup></a> recognized potential difficulties with allowing students to self-select or not, in which case the teacher selected the group composition. However, there is another consideration with student-selected groups which was not discussed, which relates to the potential disadvantage of self-selection on students who might already be marginalized. On balance Self-Selection has to be considered very carefully before adoption. A common practice of instructor-selection by grouping students based on their proximity to each other is in effect a kind of student self-selection, and instructors need to be aware of the consequences for students sitting alone.

An important finding is that "results confirm the importance of instructors actively intervening within groups to develop trust, promote participation, and create task interdependencies"<a href="#footnote-b3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The ability to intervene, especially in group work performed outside the class, is heavily dependent on the teacher being aware. Encouraging group work to be done in a medium where the teacher can observe and has access to analytics reflecting participation, such as MeTL [Groups](guide-groups.html), has the potential to provide the teacher with a window into group work.

Harvard Law School advises faculty to thoughtfully construct groups. "With diversity in mind, teachers should assemble groups according to a common interest. If you allow students to self-select, it is important to help them build diverse teams"<a href="#footnote-b4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Further "Weimer has found that students who don’t know each other before they do group work often create the most outstanding work, whereas student who already know each other tend to socialize more and make less progress during group work, thereby not producing exceptional results" (reference not attributed)<a href="#footnote-b4"><sup>4</sup></a>.

#### Teacher-Selection

In the absence of allowing [Self-Selection](#self-selection) by students the onus of forming the groups falls on the teacher. The teacher can avoid making selective decisions by [Random-Selection](#random-selection) of students. However, this may not be easy and ideally requires some thought and process. Increasingly teachers are selectively assigning students to groups based on criteria, which can be shared, homogeneous grouping or, when the criteria are balanced, heterogeneous grouping. Apart from [Random-Selection](#random-selection), all the methods of Teacher-Selection are contentious for various reasons. However, not often considered is the problem of whether the teacher has enough information to apply selection criteria unless those criteria are based on factors such as socio-economic status, gender or race. Using gender or race is highly problematic, if not illegal, though at least one available group construction system does gather this information. Socio-economic status is known to have effects on education outcomes <a href="#footnote-c1"><sup>1</sup></a> in that educational attainment is positively correlated across generations, so using this as a criterion must be carefully considered.

One obvious issue with any teacher-selection is that often groups are established early in the experience of the teacher with the class. This means that the teacher is very unlikely to have an informed base on which to make decisions, and those teachers willing to make selections should be aware of the Dunning-Kruger effect<a href="#footnote-c2"><sup>2</sup></a>.

The most common Teacher-Selection method is one based on ability, yet ability should be affected by the influence of the teacher during their exposure to the students, and therefore should be labile if the teacher has any effect. Using grades as a measure of ability is therefore questionable on several counts. Using other criteria such as gender or race has prejudicial issues. Therefore, Teacher-Selection is fraught. In spite of these concerns there is a large literature (see [Learning in Groups](#learning-in-groups) for a brief discussion) about the advantages and disadvantages of grouping based on similar or different attributes. The point here is not so much about the validity of those arguments but rather: is the teacher sufficiently informed to even attempt to make such groups? The solution requires analysis of significant amounts of data that is likely to be beyond the reach or capacity of any teacher. MeTL is attempting to address this issue with the construction of [Smart-Selection](#smart-selection), which is predicated on the assumption that the teacher for good reason wishes to choose some variant of attribute selection, based on a choice of rules the teacher should understand before using. If there is insufficient information for [Smart-Selection](#smart-selection) then students will be assigned to groups using a true [Random-Selection](#random-selection) algorithm.

#### Random-Selection

Randomness is complicated and not easy to achieve. For example the *call-off system* "is when the lecturer walks around the room and assigns each student in the class a number in a systematic call off (ie. 1,2,3,4,5 ... 1,2,3,4,5 ... etc. or A,B,C ... etc.). Groups are then formed by putting all the 1’s, 2’s etc together. Other random appointment methods include students drawing numbers from a "hat" ... or the lecturer drawing them out"<a href="#footnote-d1"><sup>1</sup></a>.

The first method is not random, it is systematic, and the group size, seating position and path the lecturer takes may affect the outcome. Drawing numbers from a hat is likely to be more random.

A potential advantage of a "random" method is the claim that there is little preparation needed, but this is not necessarily true as discussed above. The potential to break up friendship groups, to allow or even require people to work with others they normally would not, which are often seen as fairer, are seen as advantages<a href="#footnote-d1"><sup>1</sup></a>. 

Students who prefer to work with friends or at least students of similar values and abilities tend not to like random-selection. There is the risk of incompatible groups being formed, which raises the important question of teaching students how to manage cooperative skills, including conflict<a href="#footnote-d1"><sup>1</sup></a>. A quick review of Gartner interview questions in various scenarios indicates the emphasis on establishing whether the potential employee can handle group situations. The first question in the group of difficult Gartner interview questions is "Tell me about a time where you had to deal with conflict on the job"<a href="#footnote-d2"><sup>2</sup></a>. 

The observation that teachers who randomly assign students to groups are lazy and uninformed is, in itself, an uninformed criticism. Arguably randomly assigning students to groups when there is little information available to the teacher is the fairest way. This is likely to be particularly true when groups are assigned early in a semester before the teacher knows enough to fairly selectively assign students to groups. The risk of ad-hoc [Teacher-Selection](#teacher-selection) based on inadequate knowledge is high and may result in hidden or even unconscious bias and prejudice. In general a frank and open discussion with the class of how best to assign students to groups is worth considering.
