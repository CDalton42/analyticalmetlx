## Canvas
 
The canvas is where instructors and students insert and share content in the form of ink 
(freehand pen strokes with finger or stylus if the device has a touch screen, and/or with a mouse), 
text and images (available on devices with and without touch screens).

## Banner

Displays the name of the conversation and the current page number.

## Health Bar

A green bar that mostly fills the box indicates a healthy network connection and the device is capable of running MeTL. 
The bar may occasionally contract and become yellow for a moment before becoming green again, this is normal. 
However, if it stays in the yellow then your internet connection is poor and/or your device is too slow to manage a 
MeTL conversation.

## Navigation

Use the navigation arrow keys to go to the next or previous page, or touch on the thumbnail of the page you wish to 
join and display.

## Add Page

This button adds a blank page immediately after the current page being displayed.

## Thumbnails

Previews of all pages in the conversation are displayed. You can increase the size of the thumbnails by pressing 
Ctrl+ or Ctrl-.
