title: Feature Compatibility
---

This table contains some known issues with the commonly used browsers that MeTL is tested with.
It is not an exhaustive list of features or browsers. 

Development and testing are primarily performed on Chrome, Edge and Safari. Firefox and IE are generally less 
compatible with MeTL, so some features may not work as intended. Opera is untested.

MeTL is designed with a responsive layout that works on both PCs and tablets. We test on large monitors, 
iPads and iPad minis.
