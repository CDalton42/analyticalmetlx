![Conversation Search](images/guide-edit-conversation.png)

a.	Edit a conversation name. Delete the current conversation name, or parts of it and type in the new 
conversation name. Give some thought to making this unique and hierarchical such as “EDU123 Week 1 Tuesday”. 
Coupled with appropriate sharing controls this will make it easier for the students and instructor to find a 
particular conversation.

b.	Sharing allows the owner (creator) of a conversation to set sharing rights. If sharing is set to the owner then 
no one else can see or join it. This allows a conversation to be developed over time. 
It will not be visible to students until the share control is changed to the class. 
It is good practice not to leave the conversation Unrestricted as anyone can see it, 
but it also clutters up the search screen.

c.	Archive allows the owner to archive and remove a conversation from the search list. It can be recovered by 
selecting Include my archived conversations in the Search screen, clicking on Edit and then Unarchive. However, 
it is important not to Archive conversations that students might have contributed to.
