## Edit name
 
This is the name used when searching for a conversation. 
It may be directly modified within the edit box. 

> **Tip**
>
> Use unique and hierarchical names for conversations such as *EDU123 Week 1 Tuesday*. 
> This will make it easier for the teacher and students to find a particular conversation.

## Sharing

A conversation is initially created with `Unrestricted` sharing, which means that all MeTL users can see and join it. 
The creator of a conversation may restrict access by using the dropdowns and radio buttons. 

If sharing is set to the creator then no one else can see or join it.

> **Tip**
>
> Restricting conversation sharing to the creator allows a conversation to be developed over time before making it visible to others. 

If sharing is set to the class then all students in that class can see and join it. 

> **Tip**
>
> Restricting the sharing of a conversation by groups reduces clutter for other users when they are searching for conversations.  

## Archive

Archiving a conversation removes it from search results for all users (including the creator). 
It can be found by selecting [`Include my archived conversations`]({{site.baseurl}}/guide-conversations.html#include-my-archived-conversations). 

> **Tip**
>
> Archiving a conversation will prevent students from seeing their own work. 
> Conversations that students may have contributed to should not be archived until after all students have left the class that the conversation is shared with (eg end of semester).
