This fixtures directory contains the mongo data which serves the analytical front end at /summaries.

It will be loaded by the TopicManager contained in StackManager.scala, and other associated classes.

For the system to run, it must have had the data loaded into its addressed mongo instance.  The syntax for this command is:

mongorestore mongo.dump
