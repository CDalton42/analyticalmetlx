Reading







“Psychology has a long past, 
but only a short history” 
  Hermann Ebbinghaus (1910, cited in Thorne & Henley, 1997, p. 8) 

 ‘Birth’ of psychology in 1879
Wundt established the first psychology laboratory

Most argue we need to go further back to the ideas of the early philosophers

Also need to consider how contributions in other areas of science have influenced psychology
e.g., physiology, medicine, biology, physics, computer science

Where do we start?
Boulder Conference on Graduate Education in Clinical Psychology (1949)

Scientist – Practitioner model
Psychology education
Precursors to the birth of psychology
Philosophy
Medicine
The birth and rise of modern psychology 

New perspectives from clinical practice

Lecture structured around 3 themes:
Before Psychology
Experimental Psychology 
Clinical perspectives
Psychology grew out of philosophy

Persistent questions:
The mind-body problem
The origins of human knowledge
Nature vs. nurture
Relationship between humans and non-human animals







Why Philosophy?
Rene Descartes (1596-1650)
French mathematician,
    physiologist, philosopher
Challenged dogma by                                                   resolving to doubt everything

“Cogito ergo sum” or “I think, therefore I am”

Mind-body dualism
Early Modern Philosophy
Rejected rationalist doctrine of innate ideas (Descartes)

All knowledge is derived from experience, mainly sensory experience
British empiricism
The human mind begins as
    a “tabula rasa” and we
    learn through experience

Two sources of ideas from experience:
    1. Sensation and 2. Reflection 
John Locke (1632-1702)
David Hume (1711-1776)
Organization of ideas according to laws of association:

Law of resemblance (similarity)

Law of contiguity (same time and place)

Law of cause and effect (form a connection as ‘habit’ of mind built up over time)

Rationalists (like Descartes) contend the way to knowledge is only through reason and thought; mind actively transforms sensory information

Empiricists (like Locke) argue all knowledge is gained through experience; with emphasis on the method of using observation and sensory impressions to build knowledge
Laws of association
Empiricism vs. Rationalism
Both rationalist and empirical approaches have their place. . . 

	The type of work favoured by empiricists is empirical work. By definition, an empirical project is one that requires observation at some point. The type of work favored by rationalists is theoretical work, a theoretical project being defined as one that does not require observation at any stage (Kukla, 2001, pp. 1-2).

‘de-mystification’ of the nervous system
Nerve function
 Muller, Helmholtz
Localisation of function
Gall, Flourens, Broca
19th century developments in physiology / medicine
PSY1011 History 2007 WMcK Lecture 2
These bumps on the surface of the head correspond with underlying brain functions
Gall’s Phrenology or Cranioscopy – became fashionable

Underlying assumptions:
Indentations and bumps on the outer contours of skull reflect contours of brain;
Brain can be divided into small number of functions
Mind’s functions located in specific areas of the brain
Franz Joseph Gall (1758-1828)
(Germany)
Published clinical evidence:
    injuries to specific areas in
    left cortical hemisphere
    of brain lead to specific
    loss of speech production—
    known as Broca’s area 
Later Wernicke’s area shown to be associated with deficits in speech comprehension
Supported the localisation of function position
Paul Broca (1824-1880)
(France)
Broca’s area: damage to the left inferior frontal lobe = impairment of speech output
Wernicke’s area: damage to left hemisphere temporal lobe = impairment in speech comprehension
The beginnings of psychological measurement:  Psychophysics
Weber (1795 – 1878; Germany)
Used the two-point threshold method to show sensitivity to touch differed across different body areas

Used increases in weights to determine Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs); demonstrated judgements are relative
Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887) (Germany)

Fechner’s law: S = k log R
S = psychological sensation
k = constant
log R = log of the physical stimulus intensity

“Elements of Psychophysics” influenced early psychologists such as Wundt and Ebbinghaus
Theory of Evolution
Charles Darwin (1809-1882)

Humans have descended from animals by modification through principles of natural selection 
Change in religious and Cartesian thinking: no  separation between man and animals
Examination of emotions in humans and animals; observed universality of emotional expressions
Study of animal behaviour as model for human behaviour—influence on behaviourism
Stimulated an interest in the measurement of individual differences
Precursor to the school of functionalism

Seen as the founder of 
    experimental psychology

Began the first journal of Psychology:             Philosophical Studies (1881).

Opened up first university based lab                              of psychology at University of Leipzig (1879)






Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920)
(Germany)
Contribution of Wilhelm Wundt
Goal of Wundt’s research was to understand consciousness 
He confined experiments to immediate experience
Claimed that “the events of mental life are known through introspection”
attempted to use introspection scientifically


sought to investigate the immediate experiences 
of consciousness, including sensations, feelings,
 volitions, apperception, and ideas.

Student of Wundt
Englishman who completed PhD
    at Leipzig
Moved to US to head new Dept
    of Psych at Cornell University
Edward Titchener (1867-1927)
Goal (like Wundt): to learn about 
the structure of the mind through 
analysing elementary conscious
experience
Structuralism

Adapted Wundt’s methods, using “analytical introspection” to study the structures of the mind

Elements of consciousness: sensation, images and affections (feelings) can be known by listing attributes


Decline of structuralism partly due to criticisms of introspection as an experimental method

Titchener’s Structuralism
Opened small psychology lab at Harvard,                                        but not a research scientist
Functionalism:  “What for” (i.e. function) of mind, NOT “What is” (i.e. structures)
Consciousness evolved because it has a function—to help us in the struggle for survival
‘Principles of Psychology’ 1890
William James (1842-1910)
AIM: To examine the purpose and functions
of the mind
Influenced by Darwin: behaviour
can be understood in terms of its purpose
without analysing its mechanisms
Functionalism
Pavlov influenced by Russian physiologist Sechenov who had worked with Wundt

Studied function of conditioned reflexes 

Lead to the development of a theory of learning known as classical conditioning 

Classic example of pairing a bell (CS) and meat (UCS) to produce the conditioned response salivation
                 Ivan Pavlov (1849-1936) 
Edward Lee Thorndike (1874-1949)
Performed systematic experiments on the learning process (Columbia University, USA)

Studied S-R connections by observing the learned behaviour of cats in puzzle boxes

Law of Effect
John B. Watson (1878-1958)
Behaviourist Manifesto (1913):
	 * The rejection of introspection
    *  Emphasis on objectivity
    *  Prediction and control
    *  Use of animals



Behaviourism

Described relationship between environment (stimulus) and behaviour (response)

Made claims about the importance of education over inherited characteristics and instincts

Study of Little Albert and the white rat demonstrated the view of phobias as conditioned fear responses
Watson’s behaviourism 
Return to radical behaviourism
Skinner similarly emphasised 
    observation and control
Also argued that psychological 
    studies should only focus on 
    objective and measurable phenomena
B.F. Skinner (1904-1990)

All behaviour is determined by its consequences

Cognitive psychology
Psychologists increasingly challenged the view that cognitive events do not exist


Neobehaviourism:  Accept theoretical speculation about the existence of mediational variables (internal mental states), provided theoretical terms are operationally defined and lead to testable predictions

E.g., Clark Hull (1884-1952):  ‘drive’
         Edward Tolman (1886-1958): ‘cognitive maps’



The decline of behaviourism
1910: Max Wertheimer observed a perceptual effect named the phi phenomenon
http://www2.psych.purdue.edu/Magniphi/SimpliPhi.html

Contradicts Wundt and Titchener’s molecular approach, the goal of which was to uncover the elements of consciousness

Gestalt psychology focuses on ‘wholes’ not parts or elements of experience, the “whole is more than the sum of the parts”

Gestalt psychology
Interested in how we organise our perception of the world – as humans we tend to “fill in the blanks 

Köhler emphasised a “top-down” approach which aims to achieve closure and completion

Principles of organization

Insight learning in chimpanzees

    1886 – 1941
    1887 – 1967
Experimental studies of cognitive abilities:

Sir Frederic Bartlett (1932) describes the role of schemas in “reconstructive memory” 

Miller’s (1956) demonstrates the limited capacity of short-term memory as the magical number 7 (± 2)




Forerunners to the cognitive revolution
Forerunners to the cognitive revolution
Lev Vygotsky described the development of self in conversational practices
“Thought and language” banned until 1956, published in English 1962



Jean Piaget examined cognitive development
“Psychology of Intelligence” translated into English 1950



Vygotsky (1896-1934)
Piaget (1896-1980)
Noam Chomsky’s (1959) review of Skinner’s Verbal Learning argued that Behaviourism cannot explain language learning

His approach has been described as Cartesian and Rationalist

Suggested that we are preprogrammed to learn grammatical rules



Further challenges to behaviourism
(1928 -  )
The focus is on internal representations of the external world

View of human beings as active, information processors
Computational models:  Thought or cognition IS the computer-like processing of information and symbols in rule governed ways
Connectionism (neural networks) – 1980s:  
‘neurally inspired’ 
parallel processing

Cognitive Science
study of the mind / interdisciplinary
view that science and philosophy can be combined

Greater acceptance that cognitive events exist contributed to the decline of behaviourism

Experimental studies on cognitive abilities encouraged the emergence of mentalist psychology

Chomsky challenged the behaviourist interpretation of language learning

Encouraged research by recording therapy sessions
Marcie has just started college.  She grew up in a small town but enrolled in a major city university far from home. Her family has few financial resources, and the university scholarship was her only opportunity for a university education. She was reluctant to leave home, but her family and teachers encouraged her because it was a tremendous opportunity.  When Marcie was a child, she went to camp one summer and was very homesick for an entire week. Now Marcie is having those same feelings again as she tries to adjust to university life in a new city. She is very sad, cries for no reason, and has stopped attending classes. She believes she is a failure for being unable to adjust and is afraid to tell her parents how she feels. She barely talks to her housemate, who is very concerned about the change in her behaviour. Marcie no longer takes a shower, sometimes does not get out of bed, and will go for several days without eating.
The Patient … through the ages 
Early approaches based on hypnosis, trauma and hysteria

Emerging psychological focus

Psychoanalytic ‘talking cure’ dominates

Behaviourist rival emerges

Humanistic approach as the ‘third force’

Eclectic approaches emerge, integration and re-invention
