		<h2><a href="http://metl.adm.monash.edu.au/MeTL2011/">MeTL 2011</a></h2>
		<p>MeTL is a windows client for the MeTL system.  It requires Dot.Net 3.5 SP1 or later to run, and permits full collaboration between all participants in a MeTL conversation.  It enables conversation participants to ink, insert and manipulate images and text, follow the conversation owner throughout the conversation, respond to quizzes and submit unsolicited rich media to the conversation owner.  It enables users to create new conversations, insert and reorder slides, and to import Microsoft Powerpoint files to use as the basis of new MeTL conversations.  It allows the owner of a conversation to manage the participants of that conversation.</p>
		<h2><a href="/metlviewer">MeTL Viewer</a></h2>
		<p>MeTL Viewer is a http1.0 compliant non-collaborative web-client for the MeTL system.  It will ensure that students are up to date with the content on the slide, but it is only possible to interact with the class by responding to quizzes.  While javascript is beneficial to enable periodic refreshing of slide content, it is not necessary, and the system will continue to display content correctly without it.</p>
		<h2><a href="/board">MeTL X</a></h2>
		<p>MeTL X is a fully collaborative web-client for the MeTL system.  It requires javascript to run.  It enables conversation participants to ink, insert and manipulate images and text, follow the conversation owner throughout the conversation, respond to quizzes and submit unsolicited rich media to the conversation owner.  It enables users to create new conversations and insert slides into existing conversations.</p>
		<h2><a href="/summaries">Analytics</a></h2>
		<p>Analytics is a tool for analysing the quality of conversations in the MeTL system.  It requires javascript to run.  It provides a number of investigative tools to determine the interaction between conversation participants, and it correlates that information against other external systems, such as discussions from Monash Quandary, notes taken in Google Docs, and activites recorded at Monash University by Echo360.</p>
